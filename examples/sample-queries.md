## üí° Query Best Practices

### Effective Query Structure
1. **Be specific**: Include service names, time ranges, and metrics
2. **Use context**: Reference your specific environment and resources
3. **Ask for analysis**: Request insights, not just data
4. **Combine services**: Ask for cross-service correlation

### Example Improvements
‚ùå **Vague**: "Show me costs"
‚úÖ **Specific**: "Analyze my AWS costs for the last 7 days and identify the top 5 spending services"

‚ùå **Data only**: "List my Lambda functions"
‚úÖ **Analysis**: "Analyze my Lambda functions for optimization opportunities and cost savings"

### Follow-up Strategies
1. **Drill down**: Ask for more details on interesting findings
2. **Cross-reference**: Connect findings across different services
3. **Action-oriented**: Ask for specific recommendations and next steps

## üîÑ Customization Guide

### Adapting Queries for Your Environment
1. **Replace service names** with your specific resources
2. **Adjust time ranges** based on your analysis needs
3. **Add environment context** (prod, staging, dev)
4. **Include business context** (project names, team ownership)

### Creating New Queries
1. **Start with discovery**: "Show me..." or "List my..."
2. **Add analysis**: "Analyze..." or "Identify..."
3. **Request recommendations**: "Suggest..." or "Recommend..."
4. **Include context**: Time ranges, specific services, business impact

**üí° Pro Tip**: Start with basic discovery queries to understand your environment, then move to analysis and optimization queries for deeper insights.
